# STATICNODE PROJECT BRIEF — DEV BUILD SCROLL  
ScrollChain Kingdom Node Department  
Assigned by: Yahawashiservant  
Vault Path: `vault://bsv/NODE-DEPARTMENT/STATICNODE-9911`

## Summary

This project is part of a larger system called ScrollChain.  
You’ve been given your own development section called **Static Node** to contribute tools and logic that help automate parts of the system.

You’ll build scrolls (APIs or interfaces) that help the main AI system run without manual input.  
In return, you earn:
- NFT badges that mark your progress
- A stake in the Static Node vault (your credit in the system)
